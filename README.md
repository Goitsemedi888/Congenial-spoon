 Are Transformers the Swiss Army Knife of  Deep Learning, or Do Classics Still Offer a Bespoke Advantage? Trauma Detection:  Transformers vs. CNN

1 Introduction
 The concept of this project and the datasets are derived from a featured competition on Kaggle
 sponsored by the Radiological Society of North America. Globally, traumatic injuries lead to
 approximately 5-6 million deaths annually, with 40 million individuals experiencing permanent
 injuries and another 100 million facing temporary injuries (Rossiter, 2022). It’s worth noting that
 the mortality caused by traumatic injuries surpasses the combined toll of all contagious diseases,
 including COVID-19 (Rossiter, 2022). This stark reality accentuates the urgent need for
 advancements in healthcare strategies to address the aftermath of traumatic injuries. Given the
 global impact of traumatic injuries, with millions of deaths and a significant number of
 individuals facing permanent or temporary injuries annually, our project aims to address this
 critical healthcare challenge.
 
 1.1 Objective
 The primary objective of our project is to assess a patient’s injury status by leveraging computer
 vision and deep learning models such as transformers and convolutional neural networks
 (Rossiter, 2022). the use of computer vision, transformers, and cnns in medical image analysis
 has shown promising results in various applications, including diagnosis and assessment. by
 applying these techniques to analyze medical images related to traumatic injuries, your project
 aims to contribute to the improvement of injury assessment, potentially leading to more effective
 and timely interventions.
 
 2 ProblemStatement
 Accurate and swift diagnosis of traumatic injuries plays a crucial role in determining patient
 outcomes and survival rates (Colak et al., 2023). Computer tomography (CT) is a commonly
 employed imaging technique to capture data from organs that may have suffered traumatic
 injuries. Deep learning methods offer a promising avenue for classifying these CT images
 efficiently. In this project, we have chosen to work with two prominent models: the Vision
 Transformer (ViT) and convolutional neural network (CNN). Our objective is to not only utilize
 these models but also compare their performance in addressing this challenge. Specifically, we
 aim to explore whether the versatile Transformer architecture can outshine traditional deep
 learning methods, such as CNN, in this critical domain (Colak et al., 2023).
 
 2.1 Injury Types
 The current issue regarding traumatic injuries is how fast the injury is identified and treated.
 There are two groups of traumatic patients, those who are in immediate need of treatment,
 meaning they may be on life support, and those how have severe injuries, but the onset of injuries
 creates further risk (Ry¨ os¨ a, 2017).
 
2.2 Problem Importance
 Most importantly, if a deep learning solution can be found which reduces the time of injury
 identification and treatment more lives can be saved
